## Getting started with Brownie

I would recommend setting up a python virtual environment first by executing:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
```

and to activate:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

To install the packages, from root project directory execute:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Running Scripts



## Testing

To run the tests:

```bash
brownie test
```

The unit tests included in this mix are very generic and should work with any ERC20 compliant smart contract. To use them in your own project, all you must do is modify the deployment logic in the [`tests/conftest.py::token`](tests/conftest.py) fixture.

## Resources

To get started with Brownie:

* Check out the other [Brownie mixes](https://github.com/brownie-mix/) that can be used as a starting point for your own contracts. They also provide example code to help you get started.
* ["Getting Started with Brownie"](https://medium.com/@iamdefinitelyahuman/getting-started-with-brownie-part-1-9b2181f4cb99) is a good tutorial to help you familiarize yourself with Brownie.
* For more in-depth information, read the [Brownie documentation](https://eth-brownie.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).
